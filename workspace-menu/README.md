## workspace menu

Adds a workspace selection before starting any DFL script.

Make a backup of _internal/setenv.bat and replace it with the new version.

Workspace folders need to be named as workspace-&lt;any name&gt;, e.g. workspace-AB, workspace-DF, etc. Best to avoid spaces and special characters, since this has not been tested thoroughly.
